Car Price Prediction Model

The price of a car is influenced by several factors such as brand goodwill, features, horsepower, mileage, and more. Predicting car prices accurately is a crucial task in the automotive and machine learning industries. This project demonstrates how to build and train a machine learning model to predict car prices based on these key attributes using Python.

The project involves essential steps like data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and training regression-based machine learning models to forecast prices. It utilizes libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for model training, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated to ensure accurate predictions, and the workflow can be extended for real-world use cases like dealership pricing tools or online car valuation platforms.

Future improvements include integrating deep learning models, deploying it as a web application, and enabling real-time price predictions via an API. This project provides a strong foundation for understanding how various car attributes influence pricing and how machine learning can be applied in the automotive domain.
